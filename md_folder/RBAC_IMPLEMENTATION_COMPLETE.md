# Dual-Level RBAC Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Backend Complete & Tested  
**Test Results:** 10/10 Tests Passing (48 Assertions)

---

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a **dual-level Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system** using Spatie Laravel Permission v6.21 with full multi-tenancy support. The system allows for:

1. **Platform-Level Roles** - For managing the SaaS platform itself (SuperAdmin, Support)
2. **Tenant-Level Roles** - For managing within each organization/agency (Admin, BranchManager, Counsellor, etc.)

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema & Migrations

#### Created/Modified Migrations:
- `2025_10_15_125831_create_permission_tables.php` - Updated Spatie migration to use ULIDs
- `2025_10_18_040432_add_organization_id_to_tenant_tables.php` - Added organization_id (nullable for users)
- `2025_10_18_060106_add_is_platform_role_to_roles_table.php` - Added is_platform_role flag
- `2025_10_18_060628_update_roles_unique_constraint.php` - Updated unique constraints for multi-tenancy

#### Key Schema Features:
- `roles.organization_id` (ULID, nullable) - NULL for platform roles
- `roles.is_platform_role` (boolean) - Distinguishes platform from tenant roles
- `permissions.organization_id` (ULID, nullable) - For tenant-scoped permissions
- `model_has_roles.organization_id` (ULID, nullable) - NULL for platform user role assignments
- `model_has_permissions.organization_id` (ULID, nullable) - NULL for platform user permissions
- Unique constraint: `[organization_id, name, guard_name]` - Allows same role names across organizations

### 2. Configuration

#### Updated Files:
- `config/permission.php`
  - Enabled teams feature: `'teams' => true`
  - Set team foreign key: `'team_foreign_key' => 'organization_id'`

#### User Model:
- Added `HasRoles` trait from Spatie Permission
- Supports both platform users (`organization_id=null`) and tenant users

### 3. Seeders

#### PermissionsSeeder (79 total permissions)
**Platform Permissions (7):**
- manage-organizations
- view-all-organizations
- suspend-organizations
- manage-platform-settings
- view-platform-analytics
- manage-platform-users
- view-system-logs

**Tenant Permissions (72):**
- **Leads:** 6 permissions (create, view, edit, delete, export, assign)
- **Students:** 5 permissions (create, view, edit, delete, export)
- **Applications:** 8 permissions (create, view, edit, delete, submit, process, track, export)
- **Institutions:** 4 permissions (create, view, edit, delete)
- **Courses:** 5 permissions (create, view, edit, delete, search)
- **Branches:** 5 permissions (create, view, edit, delete, manage-branch-users)
- **Users:** 6 permissions (create, view, edit, delete, assign-roles, manage-permissions)
- **Reports:** 4 permissions (view, export, view-analytics, view-dashboard)
- **Financial:** 5 permissions (view-payments, manage-payments, view-invoices, manage-invoices, view-commissions)
- **Representing Countries:** 5 permissions (create, view, edit, delete, manage-country-status)
- **Tasks & Follow-ups:** 9 permissions (create, view, edit, delete, assign tasks + create, view, edit, delete follow-ups)
- **Settings:** 3 permissions (view, edit, manage-organization)

#### PlatformRolesSeeder
**SuperAdmin Role:**
- `is_platform_role = true`
- `organization_id = null`
- Has all 7 platform permissions
- Can manage the entire SaaS platform

**Support Role:**
- `is_platform_role = true`
- `organization_id = null`
- Has 3 view-only platform permissions (view-all-organizations, view-platform-analytics, view-system-logs)

#### TenantRolesSeeder (6 roles per organization)
**1. Admin:**
- Full access within organization
- All 72 tenant permissions

**2. BranchManager:**
- Manage specific branch
- 30+ permissions (leads, students, applications, branches, reports, tasks)

**3. Counsellor:**
- Manage students and applications
- 20+ permissions (students, applications, institutions, courses, tasks, follow-ups)

**4. ProcessingOfficer:**
- Process applications
- 15+ permissions (view students, process applications, view institutions/courses)

**5. FrontOffice:**
- Lead capture and initial contact
- 10+ permissions (create/view leads, view courses, create follow-ups)

**6. Finance:**
- Financial tracking and invoicing
- 12+ permissions (view applications/students, all financial permissions, reports)

### 4. Middleware

#### SetPermissionsTeam
- Automatically sets `setPermissionsTeamId()` based on authenticated user's `organization_id`
- Registered globally in `bootstrap/app.php` after `SetTenantContext`
- Ensures all permission checks are scoped to the correct organization
- Platform users (`organization_id=null`) have no team context

### 5. Organization Registration Integration

#### Updated OrganizationRegistrationController:
```php
// Auto-create tenant roles when organization registers
setPermissionsTeamId($organization->id);
$tenantRolesSeeder = new \Database\Seeders\TenantRolesSeeder();
$tenantRolesSeeder->createTenantRoles($organization);

// Assign Admin role to the user who registered
$user->assignRole('Admin');
```

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite

#### Tests Created: `tests/Feature/RBAC/RBACTest.php`

**Test Coverage (10 tests, 48 assertions - ALL PASSING ✅):**

1. ✅ Platform roles are created with is_platform_role flag
2. ✅ Platform SuperAdmin role has all platform permissions
3. ✅ Platform users can be assigned platform roles
4. ✅ Tenant roles are created for each organization
5. ✅ Tenant roles have correct permissions
6. ✅ Users can only have roles from their organization
7. ✅ Organization admin can see only their organization roles
8. ✅ Organization registration creates tenant roles and assigns Admin role
9. ✅ SetPermissionsTeam middleware sets team context based on user organization
10. ✅ Users can check permissions based on their roles

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Dual-Level Separation
```
Platform Level (Central App)
├── SuperAdmin (organization_id = null, is_platform_role = true)
└── Support (organization_id = null, is_platform_role = true)

Tenant Level (Organization 1)
├── Admin (organization_id = org1_id, is_platform_role = false)
├── BranchManager (organization_id = org1_id, is_platform_role = false)
├── Counsellor (organization_id = org1_id, is_platform_role = false)
├── ProcessingOfficer (organization_id = org1_id, is_platform_role = false)
├── FrontOffice (organization_id = org1_id, is_platform_role = false)
└── Finance (organization_id = org1_id, is_platform_role = false)

Tenant Level (Organization 2)
├── Admin (organization_id = org2_id, is_platform_role = false)
└── ... (same 6 roles, different org)
```

### Permission Scoping Flow
```
1. User authenticates
2. SetTenantContext middleware sets tenant
3. SetPermissionsTeam middleware calls setPermissionsTeamId($user->organization_id)
4. All role/permission checks are automatically scoped to that organization
5. Platform users (organization_id=null) bypass tenant scoping
```

### Role Assignment Example
```php
// Platform user
$platformUser = User::create(['organization_id' => null, ...]);
setPermissionsTeamId(null);
$platformUser->assignRole('SuperAdmin'); // Platform role

// Tenant user
$tenantUser = User::create(['organization_id' => $org->id, ...]);
setPermissionsTeamId($org->id);
$tenantUser->assignRole('Admin'); // Tenant role for this org
```

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Checking Permissions in Controllers
```php
// Automatic team scoping via middleware
public function store(Request $request)
{
    // Already scoped to user's organization by middleware
    $this->authorize('create-students');
    
    // Or check in code
    if (auth()->user()->can('create-students')) {
        // Do something
    }
}
```

### Using Blade Directives
```blade
@can('create-students')
    <button>Add Student</button>
@endcan

@role('Admin')
    <a href="/admin/settings">Settings</a>
@endrole
```

### Route Middleware
```php
// In routes/web.php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:Admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin/users', [UserController::class, 'index']);
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'permission:create-students'])->group(function () {
    Route::post('/students', [StudentController::class, 'store']);
});
```

### Checking Platform Roles
```php
// Check if user is platform admin
if (auth()->user()->organization_id === null && 
    auth()->user()->hasRole('SuperAdmin')) {
    // Platform admin logic
}

// Or use permission
if (auth()->user()->can('manage-organizations')) {
    // Can manage all organizations
}
```

## 🚀 What's Next (Pending Frontend)

### TODO #6: Create RoleScope Helper
Create a helper to easily fetch organization-specific roles:
```php
// app/Helpers/RoleHelper.php
public static function getOrganizationRoles(Organization $org): Collection
{
    setPermissionsTeamId($org->id);
    return Role::where('organization_id', $org->id)->get();
}
```

### TODO #7: Build Role Assignment UI (Tenant Admin)
- User management page
- Role selection dropdown (filtered to organization roles)
- Assign/revoke roles interface
- Permission visualization

### TODO #8: Build Super Admin Panel (Platform)
- Organization list with management
- Platform user management
- Platform role assignment (SuperAdmin, Support)
- System analytics and logs

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Spatie Permission Teams Feature** is powerful for multi-tenancy but requires:
   - Proper configuration (`teams => true`, `team_foreign_key => 'organization_id'`)
   - Correct data types (ULID in our case)
   - Nullable organization_id for platform users/roles

2. **Dual-Level RBAC** works by:
   - Using `is_platform_role` boolean to distinguish role types
   - Setting `organization_id=null` for platform roles/users
   - Automatic team context via middleware

3. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Test both platform and tenant role scenarios
   - Verify organization scoping works correctly
   - Test role assignments and permission checks
   - Ensure registration flow creates roles automatically

## 🎉 Conclusion

The dual-level RBAC system is now **fully implemented and tested** at the backend level. The system:

✅ Supports both platform and tenant roles seamlessly  
✅ Properly scopes permissions to organizations using Spatie's teams feature  
✅ Automatically creates roles during organization registration  
✅ Handles platform users (SuperAdmin, Support) without organization_id  
✅ Has comprehensive test coverage (10 tests, 48 assertions - all passing)  
✅ Is production-ready for backend use  

**Frontend UI components** (role assignment, user management, super admin panel) remain as future work but the backend foundation is solid and ready to support them.
