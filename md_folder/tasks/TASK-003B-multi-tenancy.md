## Architecture

**Type:** Shared Database with Organization Scoping  
**Pattern:** Global Query Scope + Automatic Assignment  

### Tenant-Scoped Models (9):
Branch, RepresentingCountry, Institution, Course, Student, Lead, Application, Task, FollowUp

### Special Cases:
- **User:** Manual relationship (no trait - prevents circular dependency)
- **Organization:** Root entity (no scoping needed)

### Global Data (Shared):
- Countries (193 auto-seeded)
- ApplicationProcess (12 templates)
- Roles & Permissions (Spatie)

| Premium | $99/month | 25 users, Unlimited students, Advanced analytics |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited users, 24/7 support, Custom integrations |

## Test Results

- Total Tests: 125
- Assertions: 412
- Failures: 0
