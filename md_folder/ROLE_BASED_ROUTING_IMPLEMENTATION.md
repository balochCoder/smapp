# Role-Based Routing Implementation

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  
**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Implementation Time:** ~1 hour

---

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive role-based routing system where each tenant role has its own dedicated dashboard and feature set with different access levels.

---

## Architecture

### Route Structure

```
/dashboard                    ‚Üí Smart redirect to role-specific dashboard
/admin/*                      ‚Üí Admin role (full access)
/branch/*                     ‚Üí Branch Manager role (limited access)
/counsellor/*                 ‚Üí Counsellor role (view-only access)
/processing/*                 ‚Üí Processing Officer role
/frontoffice/*                ‚Üí Front Office role
/finance/*                    ‚Üí Finance role
/platform/*                   ‚Üí SuperAdmin & Support roles
```

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Smart Dashboard Routing**
- Users are automatically redirected to their role-specific dashboard
- Priority order: SuperAdmin > Support > Admin > BranchManager > Counsellor > ProcessingOfficer > FrontOffice > Finance
- Implemented in `DashboardController@index`

### 2. **Role-Based Controllers**
Each role has its own controller namespace:
- `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\*` - Full CRUD access
- `App\Http\Controllers\Branch\*` - View and limited edit
- `App\Http\Controllers\Counsellor\*` - View only
- Other roles can be added similarly

### 3. **Different UI Per Role**
Each role has its own React page components:
- `resources/js/pages/admin/*` - Full featured UI
- `resources/js/pages/branch/*` - Limited UI
- `resources/js/pages/counsellor/*` - Simplified UI

### 4. **Permission Checks**
- All controllers use `$this->authorize()` for permission checks
- Permissions are passed to frontend components
- UI adapts based on user permissions

## Implementation Details

### Backend Structure

#### Controllers Created
```
app/Http/Controllers/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DashboardController.php (smart redirect)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Admin/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RepresentingCountryController.php (full CRUD)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Branch/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RepresentingCountryController.php (view only)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Counsellor/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RepresentingCountryController.php (view only)
```

#### Routes (`routes/web.php`)
```php
// Smart dashboard redirect
Route::get('dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index']);

// Admin routes (full access)
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'role:Admin'])
    ->prefix('admin')
    ->name('admin.')
    ->group(function () {
        Route::resource('representing-countries', Admin\RepresentingCountryController::class);
        // ... all CRUD routes
    });

// Branch routes (limited access)
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'role:BranchManager'])
    ->prefix('branch')
    ->name('branch.')
    ->group(function () {
        Route::get('representing-countries', [Branch\RepresentingCountryController::class, 'index']);
        Route::get('representing-countries/{representingCountry}', [Branch\RepresentingCountryController::class, 'show']);
    });

// Similar for other roles...
```

### Frontend Structure

#### Pages Created
```
resources/js/pages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ representing-countries/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx (full table with all actions)

## Authorization Flow

1. **Route Middleware:** `role:Admin` checks if user has the role
2. **Controller Authorization:** `$this->authorize('view-representing-countries')` checks permissions
3. **Frontend Permissions:** Passed as props to conditionally render UI elements

```php
// Controller example
public function index(): Response
{
    $this->authorize('view-representing-countries');
    
    return Inertia::render('admin/representing-countries/index', [
        'permissions' => [
            'canCreate' => auth()->user()->can('create-representing-countries'),
            'canEdit' => auth()->user()->can('edit-representing-countries'),
            'canDelete' => auth()->user()->can('delete-representing-countries'),
        ],
    ]);
}
```
